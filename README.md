Regression
<br/>

Polynomial Regression is a form of linear regression in which the relationship between the independent variable x and dependent variable y is modelled as an nth-degree polynomial. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E(y | x). In this article, weâ€™ll go in-depth about polynomial regression.

**What is a Polynomial Regression?** <br/>
* There are some relationships that a researcher will hypothesize is curvilinear. Clearly, such types of cases will include a polynomial term.

* Inspection of residuals. If we try to fit a linear model to curved data, a scatter plot of residuals (Y-axis) on the predictor (X-axis) will have patches of many positive residuals in the middle. Hence in such a situation, it is not appropriate.

* An assumption in the usual multiple linear regression analysis is that all the independent variables are independent. In the polynomial regression model, this assumption is not satisfied.

**Why Polynomial Regression?** <br/>
Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis used in statistics and machine learning when the relationship between the independent variable (input) and the dependent variable (output) is not linear. While simple linear regression models the relationship as a straight line, polynomial regression allows for more flexibility by fitting a polynomial equation to the data. <br/>
When the relationship between the variables is better represented by a curve rather than a straight line, polynomial regression can capture the non-linear patterns in the data. <br/>
